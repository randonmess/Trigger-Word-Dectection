# Trigger-Word-Dectection
Using TF Keras to implement a Convolution to GRU sequence to sequence network for trigger word detection. Also synthesized audio dataset

**Note: `XY_dev` and `XY_train` folders and files within could not be uploaded due to size**

## Objectives
- Structure a speech recognition project
- Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
- Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions

## Results
- the model acheived a 92% accuracy score on the test set, however metrics should be revisited due to the imbalance of the data
